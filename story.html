            <h1>How We Started</h1>
            
            
            <p>Rainbow Trout Kitchen's granola was founded by then eight year old, Peter Bowles, who got the recipe on a fly-fishing trip and started his business in the family kitchen. Over the years, Peter grew the company, selling to clients all across the state of Virginia. As he headed to college in 2020, his mother, Jakie, brought in her good friend Ashley to buy the business.

</p>
            <br>
            <p>Friends & partners for years on local community projects, the two scaled the business with the hope to take Rainbow Trout Kitchen nationwide. Rainbow Trout Kitchen offers two flavors - Classic Almond and Triple Seed Berry (gluten-free). One bite & you're hooked!
