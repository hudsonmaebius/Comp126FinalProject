                <h3>Granola Cookies</h3>
                <p>Ingredients:
                1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
                1 ¾ cups brown sugar (firmly packed)
                1 tsp. salt
                1 tsp. cinnamon
                ¼ tsp. baking soda
                1 cup (2 sticks) softened butter
                2 eggs
                1 tsp. vanilla or almond extract
                1 tbsp. nonfat yogurt (optional, for chewier cookies)
                3 ½ cups Rainbow Trout Kitchen’s Granola
                </p>
                <p>Instructions:
                Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
                In a large mixer bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda.
                Add the butter, eggs, and vanilla or almond extract. If you want extra chewy cookies, mix in 1 tablespoon of nonfat yogurt.
                Hand-stir the 3 ½ cups of Rainbow Trout Kitchen’s Granola into the dough.
                Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls, placing them 2 inches apart on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.
                Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown.
                Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

                <h3>Baked Brie with Granola</h3>
                <p>Ingredients:
                Wheel of Brie (8 oz).
                ⅓ cup cherry or other fruit preserves or jam.
                Fresh rosemary sprig or 1 tsp of dried rosemary.
                ⅓ cup Rainbow Trout Kitchen granola - either flavor! (We used Triple Seed Berry to make it gluten-free).
                Crackers or crostini for serving.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Instructions: 
                Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
                Place Brie wheel on a baking dish or small cast iron pan.
                Score the Brie slicing halfway into the cheese with each cut. This will allow the preserves to sink in.
                Spread ⅓ cup of fruit preserves or jam on top of the Brie.
                Sprinkle with rosemary and granola.
                Bake for 15 minutes, until the Brie is melted and bubbly.
                Serve warm with a side of crackers.

                <h3>Apple Granola Muffins</h3>
                <p>Ingredients:
                3/4 cups sugar
                1 egg
                ½ cup oil (vegetable, canola, or coconut oil)
                ½ Tbsp. vanilla
                1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
                ½ tsp. salt
                ½ tsp. baking soda
                ½ tsp. cinnamon
                2 apples peeled, diced small so they cook well
                1 ½ cups (divided) Rainbow Trout Kitchen - Classic Almond granola
                1 Tbsp honey</p>
                <p>Instructions: 
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line muffin tin with 12 paper or silicone liners or use oil to grease the muffin cups.
                Sift or whisk your flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon into a medium bowl. Set aside. 
                Using a mixer, cream together sugar, egg, oil and vanilla. The color will be a light yellow. 
                Add wet mixture to the dry ingredients and gently mix until combined. This thick batter will feel almost like cookie dough. Mix in the diced apples and 1 cup of classic almond granola. 
                Fill muffin cups 3/4 full, almost to the top. 
                Put the muffins in the oven for 10 minutes - half of the baking time.
                While the muffins are baking, make the granola topping. Mix 1/2 cup of granola with 1 Tbsp of honey. 
                After muffins have baked for the first 10 minutes, remove them from the oven. Using a spoon, add a scoop of granola with honey to the top to each muffin. 
                Put apple muffins back in the oven for a second 10 minutes. 
                Once they have cooled, you can gently lift the apple granola muffins out of the tin and onto a plate or into your mouth!
